# Platmorpher
A 2D Platformer game | An exercise for me to learn 2D rendering and get involved with game development  


This game is still in developement. If you would like to try it, download the source files and do ``./debug.sh`` in whatever folder you have downlaoded it.

Special thanks to https://www.youtube.com/@codergopher8270 for the SDL2 tutorial :D.
